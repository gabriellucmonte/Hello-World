# Hello-World
This is my GitHub first repository. I am graduated in Law and Master in Human Rights. I am starting to learn coding and this is where I will be giving my first steps on this whole new world for me.
I hope to succeed and hope to be able to create some interesting projects including web design and automation tools. 
Let's start!


Now I am making changes on the branch "feature", because I want to test how it works and how it communicates with the "main" branch.
